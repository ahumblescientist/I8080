# Intel 8080
This repo contains my implementaion of the [I8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080) CPU 

## Testing
all tests used for this emulator can be found [here](https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/) and cpudiag [here](http://www.emulator101.com/full-8080-emulation.html)
list of tests i used: 
- [x] cpudiag.asm
- [x] TST8080.COM
- [x] 8080PRE.COM
- [x] CPUTEST.COM (aka cpudiag II)
- [ ] 8080EXM.COM ( seems to be a bug in some alu instruction -TODO- )


# Resources 
i used alot of resources for alot of problems i stumpled upon in this project, but the most helpful were:
* [Intel 8080 Programmers manual](https://altairclone.com/downloads/manuals/8080%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf) not only it was helpful for this project, but i also learned alot of general stuff from it.
* [r/emudev](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/) on reddit and on discord too
* [full 8080 emulation](http://www.emulator101.com/full-8080-emulation.html) this was very helpful in setting up cpudiag test
* [I8080 opcode table](https://pastraiser.com/cpu/i8080/i8080_opcodes.html)
